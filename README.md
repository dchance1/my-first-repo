Project details:
This is a program written in Java that demonstates 2 threads running and the differnece in speed between recursive and dynamic methods.

The expected output is the amount of time each method (dynamic or recursive) takes to find the 40th number in the fibonacci sequence. The dynamic method should return a number very close to 0 milliseconds and the recursive method should return a number significantly larger depending on the systems cpu power. 

The program will also return what the 40th number in the fibonacci sequence is.

The important concept used in this project is the Threads. With Threads it is possible to devolope software that can do more than one thing at a time with out stopping or interrupting a programs functionality.
